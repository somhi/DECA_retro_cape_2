# Arrow DECA Retro Cape 2 (2 layer - MiSTer module SDRAM version)

**STATUS (10/03/22):  prototype desing work in progress**

Project has been developed with KiCAD 6.0. 

All credits for SDRAM design goes to Tom Verbeure from whom I've taken his [original design  files](https://github.com/tomverbeure/arrow_deca_retro_cape) and adapted to my own design.

As I already developed an Edge to Pmod PCB, I'll be using here attached to the DECA cape. See details at https://github.com/somhi/MIDI_I2S_SBC_Pmod_Edge_Interface
